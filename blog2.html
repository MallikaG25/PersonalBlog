Sugar or sugar substitutes are usually added to provide the sweet flavor that most people expect. No-sugar-added varieties of ice cream have become popular and rely on the addition of fruit and milk's natural sugars for their subtle sweetness.The variety of flavors and additives in ice cream has kept its popularity strong with consumers. From tropical fruits like mango or less common ones like pomegranate to unconventional flavors like coffee or basil, thousands of ice-cream flavors, both savory and sweet, have been created over the years.ake Tin Ice-Pots, fill them with any Sort of Cream you like, either plain or sweetenâ€™d, or Fruit in it; shut your Pots very close; to six Pots you must allow eighteen or twenty Pound of Ice, breaking the Ice very small; there will be some great Pieces, which lay at the Bottom and Top.ou must have a Pail, and lay some Straw at the Bottom; then lay in your Ice, and put in amongst it a Pound of Bay-Salt; set in your Pots of Cream, and lay Ice and Salt between every Pot, that they may not touch.
